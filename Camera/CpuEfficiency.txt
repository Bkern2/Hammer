"every 0.15ms, the ops used - the softquota is added to a counter
if higher than hard quota, e2 shuts down." (Wiremod Wiki)

note: I tend to run expressions every 0.10ms, which means that it is slightly more demanding



TIPS:
replacing if with elseif when possible (if = this true, elseif = previous statement was false & this true)

long tasks run by while will cause tick quota to exceed

3448 is the max amount of operations allowed in a tick

perf()  limits while loops to prevent exceeding quota

more variables and functions instead of repeating operations
